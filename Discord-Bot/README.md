# Discord-Bot---Python

## Project 1 - Calculator
The objective for this bot is to calculate basic arithmetic inside the discord server. The bot can also convert Hex to Binary and give ascii value. This bot was build to practice python and I have no plans to update or add more features.

Example command
```
!cal 1 + 23 / 3 * 4
```


## Project 2
The main purpose of this bot is to randomly generate 2 teams and move players accordingly to their appropriate chat channel. This project idea came from playing custom team games where we would waste time picking team captains or spend time randomizing teams. 

The way the bot works is first you type ``` $custom ```. This will allow the bot to listen for anyone entering the command ```join```. When all the players in discord have entered the command join, the user then types ```done```. The bot will then randomly select half of the people joined and move them to a different chat.

There are few small codes that i wrote to help anyone new understand how things work. Play arround with it!

I do not plan to continue this project for the same reasons stated above in project 1.
