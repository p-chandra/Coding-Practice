# Old project - Byte me (dating app)

Using android studio (kotlin) to attempt/create a dating app. Used fyrebase database to store user credentials and all front end was designed using xml and other formating language

The main jist of the code is in Kotlin. I did attemtpt to do this in Java but java is way too verbose. Use Facebook and I believe google API for the sign in feature. 

I lost most of my code when my computer died. Only have my first attempt saved :(
