# Malware-Analysis

These files contain malware and may potentially harm your system. Open in hypervisor in both windows and linux to better analyze. 

My personal tools of choice
- GHIDRA - hands down best for reverse engineering
- ollydbg
- ridare2
- binaryninja
- ProcMon

Take snapshots of register if possible since and monitor background activities/process running
