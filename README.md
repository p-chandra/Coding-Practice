# Notes

Over the years I have been diving into different fields of computer science and this is my collections of scrap notes. Mostly everything I have here is self taught stuff or some notes I just took from work. For college notes and assignments, refer to my CSUS repo.


UPDATE - July 2025
Learning about embedded systems! Attempting to study a chapter a day. Why Embedded Systems?? because it ties together reverse engineering, robotics, communication, and software engineering, all fields that I find to be complex, interesting, and enjoy. Hoping to learn enough information to change my career once again.
