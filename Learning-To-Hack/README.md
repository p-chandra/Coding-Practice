# Learn The following

This is an attempt to help individuals who want to learn how to hack but don't know where to start. I will try to provide useful links for the topics listed below and friendly CTFs that can help you get started. I also have a link in the end if you want to pursue Security Certifications. *Note: I assume you are using debian based distro such as ubuntu, kali, or my favorite kubuntu.

### Step 1 - Getting Familiar
Computer Architecture | Network | Terminal 
--- | --- | ---
[geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-and-architecture-tutorials/)| [educba](https://www.educba.com/types-of-network-attacks/?source=leftnav)  | [ryanstutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)
null | CBT Nuggets (Jeremy Cioara) | [Practice](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)


..



### Step 2 - Language
Script | High-Level | Web-Based | Low-Level
--- | --- | --- | ---
Python | [Python](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/index.html) | Javascript | [x86](https://www.nekosecurity.com/x86-64-assembly/part-1-introduction)
Bash | [C](https://www.learn-c.org/) | HTML & CSS | ARM
Perl | Java | PHP | MIPS 

<br>
I recommend Python C and x86

### Step 3 - Tools
Based on what you want to do but this picture is a good start. There are tons more but focus on the basics such as nmap, nc, gdb, etc. There are also special tools worth mentioning such as: Ghidra, Sniper, PWNTOOLS, Metasploit, Wireshark, John the Ripper, Hydra, Maltego, etc.
